## üìù Project Summary
FrogWatch USA is an organization that uses Community Conservation initiatives to gain information about specific fragile ecosystems. (You can learn more about this specific organization here: [FrogWatchUSA](<https://www.aza.org/frogwatch?locale=en>). Volunteers record which frogs they hear in their designated survey site along with other enviornmental data and submit this information to the organization. 

Historically this data is collected by snail mail making it an inefficient and cumbersome process. This site works to automate the process to save time for the volunteer and the organization.

## üßë User story:
* Volunteers create logins which are managed by a **SQL backend**.
* Volunteers can register their specific survey sites including GPS coordinates with the built in **geo-locator feature**.
* Volunteers can submit their watch logs.
  * The log form also includes valueable information about how FrogWatch wants the data collected to help the user in their logs.
  * There are **data validations** on the site which ensure proper data collection, like prohibiting forms from being submitted with empty fields, etc. 
* Volunteers can update their profile information to reflect their location, name, etc.
* Volunteers can view a summary of their logs on the home page.
* The site is **mobile compatible** so volunteers can log watches as they happen.
